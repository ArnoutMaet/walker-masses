These examples illustrate some of the core features of psiflow. All execution-side parameters should be defined in a [psiflow configuration file](/configs). Next, simply run the example and pass the configuration file as an argument:
```
python <example.py>                                    # for local execution
python <example.py> eurohpc_lumi.yaml   # remote execution on LUMI
```
